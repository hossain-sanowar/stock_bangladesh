âœ… Refined Strategy to Prioritize Investments
1. Strong Buy Filter
- Keep only stocks where:
- All 3 timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly) show "Up"
- These represent consistent upward momentum

2. Moderate Buy Opportunities
- Another group you might consider includes:
- Weekly and monthly are "Up" (strong long-term trend)
- daily is "Hold" (short-term pullback or consolidation)


4. Final Ranked List
You can now sort final selections by:
- Sector preference
- Fundamental alignment
- Historical support/resistance
